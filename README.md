#Michael Dykema Personal Website
##Intro
This is my personal website for sharing about myself. Who I am, what I've done, what I like to do, and a method to contact me. It is built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. 

This repository is only meant to show the code behind my personal website. Therefore, there are no installation or run instructions.
